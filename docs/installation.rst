Installation
------------

The first thing you want to do when using ABATE is to create a compatible virtual environment and install the ABATE package to it. To do this, you'll need to run the following three commands in your command line:


.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n ABATE pymc3
   conda activate ABATE
   pip install abate
